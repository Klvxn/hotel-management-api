    ### Usage

    Once the API is up and running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. You can use tools like `curl`, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or write your own code to make requests to the API endpoints.

    - **Rooms**: CRUD operations for managing hotel rooms.
    - **Customers**: CRUD operations for managing customer information.
    - **Reservations**: Create and manage reservations for hotel rooms.
    - **Reviews**: Create and view reviews for hotel rooms.

    For detailed information on each endpoint, see the [API documentation](#api-documentation).

    ### Authentication
